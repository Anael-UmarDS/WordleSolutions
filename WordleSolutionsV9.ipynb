        "The program, Wordle Solution, is inspired by Wordle created by The New York Times. In Wordle, the main goal is to guess a word in 6 tries. This can be hard for some users which is why this program is created.\n",
        "The program helps users by giving a list of possible solutions from Dictionary.txt for the Wordle from user inputs.\n",
        "1. Users provide characters that are in **known positions** in a 5 letter word\n",
        "2. Users can also provide or not provide characters that may be in **any position** in the 5 letter word\n",

        "All 3 of these procedures are to validate a certain character or number given by the user. The first procedure checks to see if the user input is a single alphabet. The second function checks to see if the user input for num_char, a variable that asks the user for the number of characters in unknown placement, is a number less than 5. The last procedure validates elim_char, a variable that asks the user how many characters need to be excluded from the word. It makes sure that the input is a number.\n",

The length of this list will be the same as num_char. The second list, del_char, is a list of characters that the users wants to delete or exclude from the word. This is also used in the same conditional as any_char. The length of this list is the same as elim_char. The last list is Solutions. This list will print out all solutions that fit the user inputs.

        "* These characters will later be used to create a string that would be incorporated into a conditional\n",
        "* Using these characters, the program opens a CSV file called Dictionary.txt and searches for words that contain the characters\n",
        "* The program asks users for inputs\n",
        "* Using a procedure called validate_input, the program will verify that the entered characters are single alphabetic letters\n",
        "* Program also allows user to input a number of characters in any position and ask how many characters the user wants to input as num_char. The procedure called validate num_char will verify that the inputs are integers\n",
        "* A logical string statement is created based on the input which is evaluated using the eval function later on in the program\n",
        "* A list called any_char is created, which contains all inputs from num_char in a list\n",
        "* The program looks in the dicitonary and checks if the length is 6 and the characters are in words contained by the dictionary\n",
        "* We then create a list called \"Solutions\"\n",
        "* If the words in the dictionary contain the letters, they will be added to Solutions and it will be printed as possible solutions\n",
        "* Additionally, if the length of Solutions exceeds more than 100, then the program will ask the user to enter more characters\n"
